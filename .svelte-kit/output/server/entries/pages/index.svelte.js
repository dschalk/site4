<p>This site is being developed in the SvelteKit framework. It&#39;s hosted on a Digital Ocean Debian 11 droplet. Another Digital Ocean Debian 11 droplet hosts secure JavaScript and Haskell WebSockets servers and two Haskell web servers.</p>.

<p>The topics covered on this site become increasingly diverse as I add content. It&#39;s a place for me to keep a record of discoveries and creations I don&#39;t want to lose or forget, and a place to publish things others might find useful.</p>

Both rely on Haskell WebSockets servers for most of their functionality, including multiplayer games and todo lists shared by players in each of an unlimited number of user-defined or selected groups. </p>
