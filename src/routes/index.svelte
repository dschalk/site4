<p>This site is being developed in the SvelteKit framework. It's hosted on a Digital Ocean Debian 11 droplet. Another Digital Ocean Debian 11 droplet hosts secure JavaScript and Haskell WebSockets servers and two Haskell web servers.</p>. 

<p>The topics covered on this site become increasingly diverse as I add content. It's a place for me to keep a record of discoveries and creations I don't want to lose or forget, and a place to publish things others might find useful.</p>

<p> <a href = "https://book.schalk.net">JavaScipt Monads</a> and <a href = https://score.schalk.net>"The Game of Score"</a> are back online after laying dormant on GitHub for years. Both rely on Haskell WebSockets servers for most of their functionality, including multiplayer games and todo lists shared by players in each of an unlimited number of user-defined or selected groups. </p>
